CPAN Pull Request Challenge consists in attributing each contestant a different CPAN distribution for each month of 2015, the contestant must submit at least one Pull Request to the project at github by the end of the current month.\n\nThis talk presents the challenge from the perspective of three different contestants from different parts of Brazil, with different backgrounds. In July, each contestant will have worked in 7 different distributions, meaning that we may talk about 21 different Perl projects in different areas.\n\nhttp://neilb.org/2014/11/29/pr-challenge-2015.html",
