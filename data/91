This talk presents the results of the criteria for Frama C, a Free Software static analyzer that claims to be sound. I will also try to talk about how static analyzers report their bugs vs how researchers try to classify them and where the free software comunities/tools are regarding static analysis.\n\nhttp://samate.nist.gov/SATE.html",
